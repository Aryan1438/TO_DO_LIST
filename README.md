The "To-Do List" application is a simple yet powerful command-line tool built in C++ that helps users manage their tasks and stay organized. With its intuitive interface, users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list, mark tasks as completed, and view their updated list of pending and completed tasks.

The application starts by welcoming the user and prompting them to enter tasks. Users can continue adding tasks until they type "Exit". Once all tasks are entered, the application displays the entire to-do list, with each task numbered and marked as either completed or not completed.

Users can then interactively mark tasks as completed by entering the corresponding task number. The application will update the status of the selected task and display the updated to-do list, highlighting completed tasks and pending tasks in a clear and visually appealing manner.

With its straightforward design and efficient task management capabilities, the "To-Do List" application is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to streamline their daily tasks and improve their productivity.
